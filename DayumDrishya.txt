Hey there!
It's Drishya
Soooooooo the kind of hairstyle I prefer is a little bit unexpected, not for me ofc but for y'all reading this.
I lovee dreads, 
You may call it culture appropriation,
If you do then 
You know what I'll call you?
A twat
A big f**king twat.
So returning back to the topic,
I love short dreads with fade dyed ash gray.
I feel like it suits me yk?
